# Give WordOps a Github star

Github stars are very important to give more visibility to WordOps, and attract people with skills willing to contribute to it.
It's also a source of motivation for us, because that mean people found our work useful.

WordOps stable was released only few month ago, but we added several new features since the first release as well as many improvements and bugfixes. To keep this fast release cycle, we will need more users, more suggestions, more bug reports and more contributions.

So give WordOps a Github star, by following the link at the top right of this site, if you enjoyed using WordOps.
